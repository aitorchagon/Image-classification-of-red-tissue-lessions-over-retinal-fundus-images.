# Image-classification-of-red-tissue-lessions-over-retinal-fundus-images.

The main objective of this project is to classify hard exudates on retinal fundus images. 
A method of segmentation is proposed, whose performance will be compared to the CNN performance.
The CNN created is based on ResNet50.

In the end, the CNN works better than the method of segmentation; nevertheless, the method offers pathways to be improved.
It seems like it won't be necessary a lot of changes to be able to overpass the CNN.
